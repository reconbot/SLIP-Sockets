# SLIP Sockets

This library and CDK project creates a websocket server similar to PUSHPIN and the GRIP protocol. It will make HTTP requests to your backend app in response to events (connection, disconnection and text frames). It manages a pub sub infrastructure so you can publish events to all connected websockets, and it has a client library for communication.

See the [Package README](./packages/slip-sockets/README.md) for more details.
